<strong>Twelve Years Later, We Know the Winner in Iraq: Iran</strong><br/><br/>
<em><strong>Cross-posted with <a href='http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175980/'>TomDispatch.com</a></strong></em><br/><br/><p>The U.S. is running around in circles in the Middle East, patching together coalitions here, acquiring strange
bedfellows there, and in location after location trying to figure out who the enemy of its enemy actually is. The
result is just what you'd expect: chaos further undermining whatever’s left of the nations whose frailty birthed the
jihadism America is trying to squash.</p><br/><p>And in a classic tale of unintended consequences, just about every time Washington has committed another blunder in
the Middle East, Iran has stepped in to take advantage. Consider that country the rising power in the region and credit
American clumsiness for the new Iranian ascendancy.</p><br/><p><strong>Today's News -- and Some History</strong></p><br/><p>The U.S. recently concluded <a href='http://www.newsweek.com/shia-militias-restart-tikrit-assault-isis-us-air-strikes-end-317850'>air strikes</a> in
support of the Iraqi militias that Iran favors as they took back the city of Tikrit from the Islamic State (IS). At the
same time, Washington began supplying <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/25/us-saudi-arabia-yemen_n_6944356.html'>intelligence</a> and <a href='http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/support/2015/04/06/saudi-refueling-yemen-gcc-tanker-joint-fusion-center/25360801/'>
aerial refueling</a> on demand for a Saudi bombing campaign against the militias Iran favors in Yemen. Iran continues
to advise and assist Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom Washington would still like to depose and, as part of its
Syrian strategy, continues to supply and direct Hezbollah in Lebanon, a group the U.S. considers a terror outfit.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. has successfully <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/iran-nuclear-talks-announcement-170259936.html'>negotiated</a> the outlines of an agreement with
Iran in which progress on severely constricting its nuclear program would be traded for an eventual lifting of
sanctions and the granting of diplomatic recognition. This is sure to further bolster Tehran's status as a regional
power, while weakening long-time American allies Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf States.</p><br/><p>A clever pundit could undoubtedly paint all of the above as a <a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2015/03/barack_obama_s_middle_east_gamble_the_president_is_trying_to_engage_the.html'>
realpolitik</a> ballet on Washington's part, but the truth seems so much simpler and more painful. Since the invasion
of Iraq in 2003, U.S. policy in the region has combined confusion on an immense scale with awkward bursts of
ill-coordinated and exceedingly short-term acts of expediency. The country that has most benefited is Iran. No place
illustrates this better than Iraq.</p><br/><p><strong>Iraq <em>Redux</em> (Yet Again)</strong></p><br/><p>On April 9, 2003, just over 12 years ago, U.S. troops pulled down a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/mar/09/saddam-hussein-statue-toppled-bagdhad-april-2003-video'>Firdos
Square</a>, symbolically marking what George W. Bush hoped was the beginning of a campaign to remake the Middle East in
America's image by bringing not just Iraq but Syria and Iran to heel. And there can be no question that the invasion of
Iraq did indeed set events in motion that are still remaking the region in ways once unimaginable.</p><br/><p>In the wake of the Iraq invasion and occupation, the Arab Spring blossomed and <a href='http://www.alternet.org/world/america-doubling-down-dictatorship-middle-east'>failed</a>. (The recent Obama
administration decision to resume arms exports to the military government of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Egypt could be
considered its coup de grâce.) Today, fighting ripples through Libya, Syria, Yemen, the Maghreb, the <a href='http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175945/tomgram:_nick_turse,_a_shadow_war_in_150_countries/#more'>Horn of Africa</a>,
and other parts of the Greater Middle East. Terrorists attack in once relatively peaceful places like <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/mar/18/terror-attack-tunisia-bardo-museum-live-updates'>Tunisia</a>. There
is now a <em>de facto</em> independent Kurdistan -- last a reality in the sixteenth century -- that includes the city
of Kirkuk. Previously stable countries have become roiling failed states and home to terrorist groups that didn’t even
exist when the U.S. military rolled across the Iraqi border in 2003.</p><br/><p>And, of course, 12 years later in Iraq itself the fighting roars on. Who now remembers President Obama declaring
victory in 2011 and praising American troops for coming home with their “<a href='http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-we-leave-iraq-with-heads-held-high/'>heads held high</a>”? He seemed then to be
washing his hands forever of the pile of sticky brown sand that was Bush's Iraq. Trillions had been spent, untold lives
lost or ruined, but as with Vietnam decades earlier, the U.S. was to move on and not look back. So much for the dream
of a successful <em>Pax Americana</em> in the Middle East, but at least it was all over.</p><br/><p>You know what happened next. Unlike in Vietnam, Washington did go back, quickly turning a humanitarian gesture in
August 2014 to <a href='http://wemeantwell.com/blog/2014/08/08/saveouryazidi-in-iraq/'>save</a> the <a href='http://wemeantwell.com/blog/2014/08/13/questions-about-the-yazidis-on-that-iraq-mountain/'>Yazidi</a> people from
destruction at the hands of the Islamic State into a full-scale bombing campaign in Syria and Iraq. A coalition of
<a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2014/09/25/what-the-60-members-of-the-anti-islamic-state-coalition-are-doing/'>
62 nations</a> was formed. (Where are they all now while the U.S. conducts <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/11/30/us-outpaces-allies-in-airstrike-in-iraq-syria/'>85%</a> of all air strikes
against IS?)  The tap on a massive <a href='http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175943/tomgram:_peter_van_buren,_the_military-industrial_complex_in_iraq/'>arms
flow</a> was turned on. The architect of the 2007 “<a href='http://www.commondreams.org/views/2014/06/20/reviving-successful-surge-iraq-myth'>surge</a>” in Iraq and a <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/05/petraeus-jail-leaks-edward-snowden'>leaker</a> of top secret
documents, retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus, was brought back in for advice. Twenty-four-seven
bombing became the order of the day and several thousand U.S. military advisors returned to <a href='http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/12/31/374071914/there-and-back-again-for-u-s-military-in-iraq'>familiar
bases</a> to retrain some part of an American-created army that had only recently collapsed and abandoned <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/11/mosul-isis-gunmen-middle-east-states'>four key northern cities</a> to
Islamic State militants. Iraq War 3.0 was officially underway and many pundits -- <a href='http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175898/tomgram:_peter_van_buren,_back_to_the_future_in_iraq/'>including me</a> --
predicted a steady escalation with the usual quagmire to follow.</p><br/><p>Such a result can hardly be ruled out yet, but at the moment it’s as if Barack Obama had stepped to the edge of the
Iraqi abyss, peered over, and then shrugged his shoulders. Both his administration and the U.S. military appear content
for the moment neither to pull back nor press harder.</p><br/><p>The American people seem to feel much the same way. Except in the Republican Congress (and even there in less shrill
form than usual), there are few calls for… well, anything. The ongoing air strikes remain “surgical” in domestic
politics, if not in Iraq and Syria. Hardly noticed and little reported on here, they have had next to no effect on
Americans. Yet they remain sufficient to assure the right wing that the American military is still the best tool to
solve problems abroad, while encouraging liberals who want to show that they can be as tough as anyone going into
2016.</p><br/><p>At first glance, the American version of Iraq War 3.0 has the feel of the <a href='http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/20/libya-air-strikes-what-next-gaddafi-us_n_838131.html'>Libyan air
intervention</a> -- the same lack of concern, that is, for the long game. But Iraq 2015 is no Libya 2011, because this
time while America sits back, Iran rises.</p><br/><p><strong>Iran Ascendant</strong></p><br/><p>The Middle East was ripe for change. Prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the last major transformational event in
the area was the <a href='http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/16/newsid_2530000/2530475.stm'>fall</a> of that classic
American stooge, the Shah of Iran, in 1979. Otherwise, many of the thug regimes in power since the 1960s, the height of
the Cold War, had stayed in place, and so had most of the borders set even earlier, in the <a href='http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/britain-and-france-conclude-sykes-picot-agreement'>aftermath</a> of World
War I.</p><br/><p><a href='http://www.amazon.com/dp/1935462911/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20'><img src='http://www.tomdispatch.com/images/managed/tomjoad.jpg'/></a>Iran should send America a
fruit basket to thank it for setting the stage so perfectly for its ascent. As a start, in 2003 the United States
eliminated Iran's major border threats: Iraq’s Saddam Hussein to the west and the Taliban in Afghanistan to the east.
(The Taliban are back of course, but diligently focused on America's puppet Afghan government.) The long slog of
Washington’s wars in both those countries dulled even the reliably bloodthirsty American public’s taste for yet more of
the same, and cooled off Bush-era plans in Tel Aviv and Washington for air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.
(After all, if even Vice President Dick Cheney couldn’t pull the trigger on Iran before leaving office in 2008, who in
2015 America is going to do so?)</p><br/><p>Better yet for the Iranians, when Saddam was <a href='http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/12/30/hussein/index.html?eref=rss_latest'>hanged</a> in 2006, they not only lost
an enemy who had invaded their country in 1980, launching a bitter <a href='http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/iran-iraq.htm'>war</a> against them that didn’t end for eight years,
but gained an ally in the new Iraq. As U.S. influence <a href='http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/09/29/who-won-the-war-in-iraq-heres-a-big-hint-it-wasnt-the-united-states/'>withered</a>
<a href='http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/04/obama-iraq-116708.html#ixzz3WdbwOFkQ'>away</a> with the failure
of the March 2010 Iraqi elections to produce a broadly representative government, Iran stepped in to broker a
thoroughly partisan settlement leading to a sectarian Shia government in Baghdad bent on ensuring that the country’s
minority Sunni population would remain out of power forever. The Obama administration seemed nearly oblivious to Iran's
gains in Iraq in 2010 -- and seems so again in 2015.</p><br/><p><strong>Iran in Iraq</strong><strong> </strong></p><br/><p>In Tikrit, Iranian-led Shia forces recently drove the Islamic State from the city. In charge was Qassem Suleimani,
the leader of the <a href='http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/iran/qods.htm'>Qods Force</a> (a unit
of Iran's Revolutionary Guards), who had previously <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/28/qassem-suleimani-iran-iraq-influence?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter'>
led</a> the brutally effective efforts of Iranian special forces against U.S. soldiers in Iraq War 2.0. He returned to
that country and assembled his own coalition of Shia militias to take Tikrit. All of them have long benefited from
Iranian support, as has the increasingly Shia-dominated Iraqi army.</p><br/><p>In addition, the Iranians seem to have brought in their own <a href='http://spioenkop.blogspot.com/2015/03/irans-expanding-sphere-of-influence_52.html'>tanks</a> and possibly even
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/world/middleeast/iran-gains-influence-in-iraq-as-shiite-forces-fight-isis.html'>
ground troops</a> for the assault on the city. They also moved <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/17/world/middleeast/iran-sent-arms-to-iraq-to-fight-isis-us-says.html?_r=0'>advanced
rocket systems</a> into Iraq, the same weapons Hamas has used against Israel in recent conflicts.</p><br/><p>Only one thing was lacking: air power. After <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/03/25/us-has-discussed-possible-tikrit-airstrikes-with-iraq'>much</a>
hemming and hawing, when it looked like the assault on Tikrit had been blunted by well-dug-in Islamic State fighters in
a heavily booby-trapped city, the Obama administration agreed to provide it.</p><br/><p>On the U.S. side, the air of desperation around the decision to launch air strikes on Tikrit was palpable. You could
feel it, for instance, in this statement by a Pentagon spokesperson almost pleading for the Iraqi government to favor
Washington over Tehran: "I think it's important that the Iraqis understand that what would be most helpful to them is a
reliable partner in this fight against IS. Reliable, professional, advanced military capabilities are something that
very clearly and very squarely reside with the coalition."  </p><br/><p>Imagine if you had told an American soldier -- or general -- leaving Iraq in 2011 that, just a few years later in
the country where he or she had watched friends die, the U.S. would be serving as Iran's close air support. 
Imagine if you had told him that Washington would be helping some of the same Shia militias who planted IEDs to kill
Americans go after Sunnis -- and essentially begging for the chance to do so. Who would've thunk it?</p><br/><p><strong>The Limits of Air Power 101</strong></p><br/><p>The White House no doubt <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/strikes-broke-deadlock-iraqs-tikrit-op-coalition-104911655.html'>imagined</a> that U.S. bombs
would be seen as the decisive factor in Tikrit and that the sectarian government in Baghdad would naturally come to…
What? Like us better than the Iranians?</p><br/><p>Bizarre as such a “strategy” might seem on the face of it, it has proven even stranger in practice. The biggest
problem with air power is that, while it’s good at breaking things, it isn't decisive. It cannot determine who moves
into the governor's mansion after the dust settles. Only ground forces can do that, so a victory over the Islamic State
in Tikrit, no matter what role air strikes played, can only further empower those Iranian-backed Shia militias. You
don’t have to be a military expert to know that this is the nature of air power, which makes it all the more surprising
that American strategists seem so blind to it.</p><br/><p>As for liking Washington better for its helping hand, there are few signs of that. Baghdad officials have largely
been silent on America's contribution, praising only the “air coverage of the Iraqi air force and the international
coalition.” Shia militia forces on the ground have been angered by and scornful of the United States for -- as they see
it -- <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/us-air-strikes-tikrit-iraqi-militia-leader'>interfering</a>
in their efforts to take Tikrit on their own.</p><br/><p>The victory in that city will only increase the government’s reliance on the militias, whom Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi now <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/iraq-pm-declares-victory-tikrit-battle-150536021.html'>refers</a> to as
“popular volunteers,” rather than the still-limited number of soldiers the Americans have so far been capable of
training. (The Pentagon might, by the way, want to see if Iran can pass along any training tips, as their militias,
unlike the American-backed Iraqi army, seem to be doing just fine.) That also means that the government will have no
choice but to tolerate the Shia militia <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/iraqi-provincial-council-head-says-shiite-paramilitary-fighters-175539123.html'>atrocities</a>
and acts of <a href='http://abcnews.go.com/International/dirty-brigades-us-trained-iraqi-forces-investigated-war/story?id=29193253'>ethnic
cleansing</a> that have already <a href='http://uk.businessinsider.com/iran-backed-militias-did-horrific-things-after-helping-drive-isis-from-saddam-husseins-hometown-2015-4'>
taken</a> place in Sunni Tikrit and will surely follow in any other Sunni areas similarly “liberated.” Claims coming
out of Washington that the U.S. will be carefully monitoring the acts of Iraqi forces ring increasingly hollow.</p><br/><p>What Tikrit has, in fact, done is solidify Iran’s <a href='http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Petraeus-Obama-Iran-ISIS/2015/03/20/id/631616/'>influence</a> over Prime
Minister al-Abadi, currently little more than the acting mayor of Baghdad, who <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/iraq-pm-declares-victory-tikrit-battle-150536021.html'>claimed</a> the victory in Tikrit as a
way to increase his own prestige. The win also allows his Shia-run government to seize control of the ruins of that
previously Sunni enclave. And no one should miss the obvious symbolism that lies in the fact that the first major city
retaken from the Islamic State in a Sunni area is also the birthplace of Saddam Hussein.</p><br/><p>The best the Obama administration can do is watch helplessly as Tehran and Baghdad take their <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/world/middleeast/iran-gains-influence-in-iraq-as-shiite-forces-fight-isis.html'>bows</a>.
A template has been created for a future in which other Sunni areas, including the country’s second largest city,
Mosul, and Sunni cities in Anbar Province will be similarly retaken, perhaps with the help of American air power but
almost certainly with little credit to Washington.</p><br/><p><strong>Iran in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen</strong></p><br/><p>Tehran is now playing a similarly important role in other places where U.S. policy stumbles have left voids,
particularly in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen.</p><br/><p>In Syria, Iranian forces, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the Qods Force, and their intelligence
services, <a href='http://www.understandingwar.org/report/iranian-strategy-syria'>advise and assist</a> Bashar
al-Assad’s military. They also support Hezbollah elements from Lebanon fighting on Assad's side. At best, Washington is
again playing second fiddle, using its air power against the Islamic State and training “moderate” Syrian fighters, the
first of whom <a href='http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-to-train-new-syrian-force-already-facing-logistics-diplomatic-hurdles/2015/04/03/46a6f3e8-d958-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html?postshare=3841428164939602'>
refused</a> to even show up for their initial battle.</p><br/><p>In Yemen, a U.S.-supported regime, backed by Special Forces advisers and a full-scale drone targeted assassination
campaign, recently crumbled. The American Embassy was evacuated in February, the last of those advisers in March. The
takeover of the capital, Sana'a, and later significant parts of the rest of the country by the Houthis, a rebel Shiite
minority group, represents, in the words of one <em>Foreign Policy</em> <a href='http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/08/the-iranian-sphere-of-influence-expands-into-yemen/'>writer</a>, “a huge victory
for Iran... the Houthis’ decision to tie their fate to Tehran's regional machinations risks tearing Yemen apart and
throwing the country into chaos.”</p><br/><p>The panicked Saudis promptly <a href='http://www.commondreams.org/views/2015/03/31/saudi-arabias-airstrikes-yemen-are-fueling-gulfs-fire'>intervened</a> and
were quickly <a href='http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/30/make-no-mistake-the-united-states-is-at-war-in-yemen-saudi-arabia-iran/'>backed</a>
by the Obama administration's insertion of the United States in yet another conflict by executive order. Relentless
Saudi air strikes (perhaps using some of the <a href='http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=5116'>$640 million</a> worth of cluster bombs the U.S. sold
them last year) are <a href='http://www.vocativ.com/world/yemen-world/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-war-in-yemen/'>supported</a> by yet
another coalition, this time of Sudan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and other Sunni powers in the region. The
threat of an invasion, possibly using <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/yemen-egypt-troops-houthi-rebels-air-strikes'>Egyptian</a> troops,
looms.  The Iranians have <a href='http://news.yahoo.com/iran-deploys-warships-off-yemens-coast-112617984.html'>moved ships</a> into the area in response
to a Saudi naval blockade of Yemen.</p><br/><p>No matter what happens, Iran will be strengthened. Either it will find itself in a client relationship with a Houthi
movement that has advanced to the Saudi border or, should they be driven back, a <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/26/iran-saudi-proxy-war-yemen-crisis'>chaotic</a> state in Yemen with an
ever-strengthening al-Qaeda offshoot. Either outcome would undoubtedly discombobulate the Saudis (and the Americans)
and so sit well with Iran.</p><br/><p>To make things even livelier in a fragmenting region, Sunni rebels infiltrating from neighboring Pakistan recently
<a href='http://news.yahoo.com/rebels-kill-eight-iran-soldiers-pakistan-border-052139494.html'>killed</a> eight Iranian
border guards. This probably represented a retaliatory attack in response to an earlier skirmish in which Iranian
Revolutionary Guards killed three suspected Pakistani Sunni militants. Once started, fires do tend to spread.</p><br/><p>For those keeping score at home, the Iranians now hold significant positions in three Middle Eastern countries (or
at least fragments of former countries) in addition to Iraq.</p><br/><p><strong>Iran Ascending and the Nuclear Question</strong></p><br/><p>Iran is well positioned to ascend. Geopolitically, alone in the region it is a nation that has existed more or less
within its current borders for thousands of years. It is almost completely ethnically stable and religiously,
culturally, and linguistically homogeneous, with its minorities comparatively under <a href='http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f37b3d50-6f3f-11e4-b50f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3WdTEfLGl'>control</a>. While still governed
in large part by its clerics, Iran has seen evolving democratic electoral transitions at the secular level.
Politically, history is on Iran's side. If you set aside the 1953 <a href='http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup'>CIA-backed coup</a> that ousted the
democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and put the U.S.-backed Shah in power for a quarter of a
century, Iran has sorted out its governance on its own for some time.</p><br/><p>Somehow, despite decades of sanctions, Iran, with the <a href='http://www.eia.gov/countries/country-data.cfm?fips=ir'>fourth-largest</a> proven crude oil reserves and the
second-largest natural gas reserves on the planet, has managed to hold its economy together, selling what oil it can
primarily to <a href='http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/growing-iran-oil-exports-challenge-u-s-nuclear-sanctions'>Asia</a>.
It is ready to sell more oil as soon as sanctions lift. It has a decent conventional military by local standards. Its
young reportedly <a href='http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/youth-in-iran-inside-and-out/'>yearn</a> for greater
engagement with the West. Unlike nearly every other nation in the Middle East, Iran's leaders do not rule in fear of an
Islamic revolution. They already had one -- 36 years ago.</p><br/><p>Recently, the U.S., Iran, and the P5 (Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China) reached a preliminary agreement
to significantly constrain that country’s nuclear program and lift sanctions. It appears that both the Obama
administration and Tehran are eager to turn it into an official document by the end of June. A deal isn't a deal until
signed on the dotted line, and the congressional Republicans are sharpening their knives, but the intent is clearly
there.</p><br/><p>To keep the talks on track, by the end of June the Obama administration will have released to the Islamic Republic a
total of <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/the-us-is-providing-iran-with-an-119-billion-financial-lifeline-through-june-2015-1'>$11.9
billion</a> in previously frozen assets, dating back to the 1979 Iranian takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
In addition to the straight-up flood of cash, the U.S. agreed that Iran may sell $4.2 billion worth of oil, free from
any sanctions. The U.S. will also allow Iran approximately $1.5 billion in gold sales, as well as easier access to
“humanitarian transactions.” Put another way, someone in Washington wanted this badly enough to pay for it.</p><br/><p>For President Obama and his advisers, this agreement is clearly a late grasp (or perhaps last gasp) at legacy
building, and maybe even a guilty stab at justifying that 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. The urge to etch some kind of foreign
policy success into future history books that, at the moment, threaten to be grim reading is easy enough to understand.
So it should have surprised no one that John Kerry, Obama's once <a href='http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175767/tomgram:_peter_van_buren,_americas_top_diplomat_is_lost_in_space/'>globetrotting</a>
secretary of state, basically took up residence in Switzerland to negotiate with the Iranians. He sat at the table in
Lausanne bargaining while Tikrit burned, Syria simmered, his country was chased out of Yemen, and the Saudis launched
their own war in that beleaguered country. That he had hardly a word to say about any of those events, or much of
anything else going on in the world at the time, is an indication of just how much value the Obama administration puts
on those nuclear negotiations.</p><br/><p>For the Iranians, trading progress on developing nuclear weapons for the full-scale lifting of sanctions was an
attractive offer. After all, its leaders know that the country could never go fully nuclear without ensuring
devastating Israeli strikes, and so lost little with the present agreement while gaining much. Being accepted as a peer
by Washington in such negotiations only further establishes their country’s status as a regional power. Moreover, a
nuclear agreement that widens any rift between the U.S., Israel, and the Saudis plays to Tehran's new strength.
Finally, the stronger economy likely to blossom once sanctions are lifted will offer the nation the possibility of new
revenues and renewed foreign investment. (It’s easy to imagine Chinese businesspeople on Orbitz making air reservations
as you read this.) The big winner in the nuclear deal is not difficult to suss out.</p><br/><p><strong>What Lies Ahead</strong></p><br/><p>In these last months, despite the angry, fearful cries and demands of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the
Saudi royals, and <a href='http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Petraeus-Obama-Iran-ISIS/2015/03/20/id/631616/'>neo- and other
conservatives</a> in Congress, Iran has shown few signs of aspiring to the sort of self-destruction going nuclear would
entail. (If Iran had created a bomb every time Netanyahu claimed they were on the verge of having one in the past two
decades, Tehran would be littered with them.) In fact, trading mushroom clouds with Israel and possibly the U.S. never
looked like an appealing goal to the Iranian leadership. Instead, they preferred to seek a more conventional kind of
influence throughout the Middle East. They were hardly alone in that, but their success has been singular in the region
in these years.</p><br/><p>The U.S. provided free tutorials in Afghanistan and Iraq on why actually occupying territory in the neighborhood
isn’t the road to such influence. Iran’s leaders have not ignored the advice. Instead, Iran’s rise has been stoked by a
collection of client states, aligned governments, sympathetic and/or beholden militias, and -- when all else fails --
chaotic non-states that promise less trouble and harm to Tehran than to its various potential enemies.</p><br/><p>Despite Iran's gains, the U.S. will still be the biggest kid on the block for years, possibly decades, to come. One
hopes that America will not use that military and economic strength to lash out at the new regional power it
inadvertently helped midwife. And if any of this does presage some future U.S. conflict with an Iran that has gotten
“too powerful,” then we shall have witnessed a great irony, a great tragedy, and a damn waste of American blood and
resources.</p><br/><p><em>Peter Van Buren blew the whistle on State Department waste and mismanagement during the Iraqi reconstruction in

A soccer pitch in the Iranian city of Ahvaz, home to Iran's Arab minority, has emerged as a flashpoint of
anti-government protest at a time of rising Arab-Iranian tensions over the status of Shiite Muslim minorities in the
Arab world, the crisis in Yemen, and the outlines of a multilateral agreement that would curb Iran's nuclear program
and return the Islamic republic to the fold of the international community.<br/><br/>
Soccer fans clashed with security forces last Friday after a match between state-owned Foolad FC and Teheran's
Esteghlal FC in Ahwaz, the capital of the Iranian province of Khuzestan for the second time is as many weeks, according
to the National Council of Resistance in Iran, a coalition of opposition groups dominated by the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, a
group that lost much of its credibility after it was expelled from France in 1986 and moved its operations to Iraq at a
time that Iraq was at war with Iran.<br/><br/>
The protest was sparked by mounting anger among ethnic Arabs in oil-rich but impoverished Khuzestan that constitutes
part of Iran's border with Iraq. Ethnic Arabs have long complained that the government has failed to reinvest profits
to raise the region's standards of living.<br/><br/>
The World Health Organization (WHO) identified Ahwaz in 2013 as Iran's most polluted city. Authorities distributed in
February tens of thousands of surgical masks and more than 26,000 gallons of milk in Ahvaz, a city of more than 1
million, when it was hit by a severe sand storm that forced the closure of schools and offices, the cancellation of
flights, and prompted scattered protests.<br/><br/>
In a sign of where Iranian Arab loyalties lie, environmental activists blamed Iraq rather than the Iranian government
for the degradation of Khuzestan that they said was a consequence of Iraq's failure to prevent the loss of marshlands
and the spread of desert terrain.<br/><br/>
Iranian Arabs nevertheless charge that they are being discriminated against because of Iranian government suspicions
that they are susceptible to foreign Arab influence. That suspicion is rooted in Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's bloody
eight-year war against Iran that ended in 1988. Saddam falsely expected at the time that Iranian Arabs would welcome
the opportunity to gain independence from Iran.<br/><br/>
The Iranian Arab refusal to side with Saddam failed however to earn them the credit they deserved. They have since
often framed their criticism of government policies in ethnic and nationalist terms that have served to strengthen
government distrust amid multiple proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran on the battlefields of Yemen, Syria and
Iraq; Gulf accusations of meddling by Iran in their backyard by supporting the rebel Houthis in Yemen, fuelling protest
in majority Shiite Bahrain and the oil-rich, predominantly Shiite Eastern Shiite militias in Iraq battling the Islamic
State, the jihadist group that controls a swath of Syria and Iraq.<br/><br/>
A policeman was killed and 30 protesters injured on Saturday when police allegedly attacked the Shiite village of
Awamiyah in the Eastern Province amid reports of a planned demonstration against the Saudi military intervention in
Yemen, according to the Saudi interior ministry and activists. Shiites, who assert that they suffer from discrimination
in employment and education, account for up to 15 percent of the kingdom's population. The government has repeatedly
rejected allegations of discrimination and claimed that it was confronting an armed uprising in the Eastern
Province.<br/><br/>
In a recent article in the English-language Saudi newspaper, Arab News, UAE businessman Khalaf Ahmad Al Habtoor called
for the liberation of the five million Arabs in Khuzestan which the writer described as Arabistan. Mr. Al Habtoor
asserted that the Arabs were "struggling to survive under the Persian yoke in an Arab region bordering Iraq and the
Arabian Gulf."<br/><br/>
He charged that "although Arabistan provides Iran with 80 percent of its oil requirements as well as half of its gas,
its sons are exploited and oppressed; their human rights tramped upon, their very identity in danger of being
obliterated. Iran's policy of ethnic discrimination combined with its Persian resettlement endeavours has resulted in
turning the Ahwazi Arabs into an economic and social underclass.<br/><br/>
Numerous Arab villages are without schools and those 'lucky' enough to attend school are educated in Farsi. Some 80
percent of Ahwazi Arab women are illiterate as opposed to 50 percent of Ahwazi men. Over thirty percent of the
under-30s are unemployed in this heavily industrialized region, primarily because Persians receive priority and jobs
often advertised outside the governorate," Mr. Al Habtoor said.<br/><br/>
"Thousands are without access to drinking water, because rivers have been diverted to arid Persian provinces. Their
streets open sewers; many are deprived of electricity and gas... It's no wonder that Ahwazi Arabs are now driven to
protest against such blatant discrimination," he added.<br/><br/>
Friday's soccer protest followed a similar incident two weeks ago during an Asian championship League qualifier between
Ahwaz's Foolad FC and Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia. Fans defiantly expressed support for Al Hilal and burnt pictures of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late spiritual leader who spearheaded the 1979 Iranian revolution that toppled the
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Fans also sported banners emphasizing the Arab
character of Ahvaz.<br/><br/>
Unrest in Ahwaz has been long simmering. The popular revolts of the Arab world in 2011 that toppled the autocratic
leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen reverberated in Khuzestan where protesters commemorated anti-government
demonstrations in 2005. Activists who called in April 2011 for a 'day of rage' in Ahwaz were confronted by security
forces who reportedly killed and wounded scores.<br/><br/>
Habib Jaber Al-Ahvazi, a spokesman for the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA), a group that
demands independence for Ahvaz and is believed to be responsible for a series of bomb attacks in the city in 2005, 2006
and 2013, last month told online Arab nationalist Ahvaz.tv that the soccer protests were part of an "ongoing
confrontation between demonstrators and the forces of the Persian occupation."<br/><br/>
Iranian analysts suspect Saudi Arabia of instigating the soccer protests in Khuzestan as part of an effort to
destabilize and dismember Iran. The analysts note that ASMLA operatives have maintained contacts with rebels fighting
Syria's Al Assad regime. ASMLA has also expressed support for insurgents in Iran's Baluchi and Kurdish provinces whom
the government in Tehran sees as part of US and Gulf Arab covert operations aimed at weakening it.<br/><br/>
Iran's Press TV appeared to counter reports of the soccer protest by reporting the same day that hundreds of protesters
in Tehran, Ahwaz, Ardabil, Mashhad and Tabriz had demonstrated against the Saudi military campaign in Yemen.<br/><br/>

peaceful purposes. But the important thing to know about Fordow is its underground location.</p>
